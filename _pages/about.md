Hi there! I am Rui Zhu, a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at the [School of Geographical Sciences](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/geography/), [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/) (UK). I am a geographer by training with a background in data science (so you can call me a spatial data scientist). Broadly speaking, I study how humans and machines organize spatial knowledge, as well as their interactions with the environment. More specifically, I combine theory-informed (e.g., geography and semantics) and data-driven (e.g., machine learning and spatial statistics) approaches to address geospatial challenges such as geospatial data interoperability, spatial predictions, and spatial reasoning. My work has been applied to a wide range of applications, including urban studies, global health, environmental modeling, as well as humanitarian relief.

Research Interests
======
* GeoAI 
* GIScience
* Spatial Statistics
* Spatial Data Science
* Geospatial Semantics 
* Spatiotemporal Data Mining 
* Geospatial Knowledge Graphs


Background 
======
I received my Ph.D. from the [Department of Geography](https://www.geog.ucsb.edu/), [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/). I obtained a M.S. degree in Information Sciences from the [School of Computing and Information](https://www.sci.pitt.edu/), [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/) and a B.S. degree in Information Management from the School of Information Management, Shanxi University of Finance and Economics, China. I have also worked as a Postdoctoral Scholar at the [Center for Spatial Studies, University of California, Santa Barbara](https://spatial.ucsb.edu/) and a summer data science intern at the [Geospatial Science and Human Security Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, US](https://www.ornl.gov/gshsd). 

<span>Prospective Students/Scholars</span>
======
I am recruiting talented and self-motived Master/PhD students whose research interests align with mine. In the upcoming academic year of 2022-2023, several fellowships can be applied under my supervision: 

* [SWDTP (ESRC) application deadline: 13 January 2023](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/fssl/swdtp/apply/). There are two pathways to choose if you want to study under my supervision. (Note that there might be another pathway about Sociotechnical Futures & Digital Methods being approved soon.)
	* [Advanced Quantitative Methods](https://www.swdtp.ac.uk/prospective-students-and-fellows/aqm/) +3 (have a Master degree) or 1+3 (have no Master degree)
	* [Human Geography](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/2023/ssl/phd-geographical-sciences-human-geography/) +3 (have a Master degree) or 1+3 (have no Master degree)
	
* [UoB Scholarship application deadline: 21 February 2023](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/geography/courses/postgraduate/scholarships/#UOBHG). Students who are specifically interested at the following topics are encouraged to apply: 
	* Economic, political, and social justice
	* Environment / sustainability /climate change
	* Health and social care
	* Migration and mobilities
	* Sociodigital / data science / technology
* [China Scholarship Council (CSC) application deadline: 01 December 2022](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/scholarships/china-scholarship-council/) (Note that 01 December 2022 is the University deadline to submit your application. Once you have received the offer from the University, you must apply directly to CSC for the scholarship by Friday 31 March 2023)

No matter which scholarship you are interested to apply, or if you are unsure, **I highly recommend you to contact me first by sending (1) your CV and (2) a brief reseach statement (no need to be the final version) to rui.zhu@bristol.ac.uk**. Also please be mindful of the deadline. They are the dates to submit your final application. You should contact me at least four weeks before that so that I can help you go through the process if you are qualified. 

Meanwhile, I am also considering visiting scholars who are willing to work with me at University of Bristol. Contact me if you are interested.

<!-- Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
